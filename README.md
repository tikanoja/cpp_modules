# C++ Modules 00-09

*These projects are a part of the Ecole 42 curriculum.*

## Overview

This repository contains my solutions to the series of projects under Ecole 42 CPP Modules. These exercises were my first touch with C++, transitioning from C.

## Description

The `cpp modules` cover the fundamentals of C++ programming. The modules are roughly in order by complexity. The first modules cover the basics of C++ syntax and Object-Oriented programming. The following modules add on top or this, introducing more features and concepts to utilize. Here is a summary of main lessons learned:

- **C++ as a Language**: Feels like magic to me at times. It retains C's efficiency and low-level control while allowing high level abstraction that makes the code more robust and easier to work with.
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Was a new concept to me, but one I really embrace now. It promotes clear structure, code reusability, scalability and user-friendliness for my colleagues.
- **Peer-to-Peer learning && Soft Skills**: Even though these projects were completed solo, my best resource was my fellow students. Every single exercise was evaluated by a peer (and I also evaluated theirs!), so we had plenty of interesting discussions about best practises and alternative ways to solve problems.

## Key topics

The modules cover the following topics:

| Module | Topics                                                              |
